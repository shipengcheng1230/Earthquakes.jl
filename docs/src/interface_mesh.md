# Mesh

This package provides some buildin structured mesh functionality and some
  data structures coupled with existing Green's functions where users could
  explore external mesh tools.

This package also has rich utilities based on [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/).
  To use them, it is recommended to install
  [GmshTools.jl](https://github.com/shipengcheng1230/GmshTools.jl) which
  automatically downloads Gmsh SDK and provides a few convenient macros.


```julia
pkg> add GmshTools
julia> using JuEQ
julia> using GmshTools
```

Users are encouraged to read [Gmsh Julia API](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/blob/master/api/gmsh.jl) for more comprehensive operations.
