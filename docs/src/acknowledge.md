# Acknowledge

The simulation of episodic seismic and slow slip events using boundary-element-method
for pure elastic fault is largely benefit from
[Yajing Liu](https://liumcgill.wordpress.com/) original Fortran code.

This package isn't possible without a collaborating Julia community. Thanks to
all the authors in the [dependent packages](https://github.com/shipengcheng1230/JuEQ.jl/blob/master/Project.toml).
