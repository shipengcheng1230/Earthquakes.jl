This is a suite for numerically simulating earthquake sequences in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). The purpose of this package is to provide efficient Julia implementations for simulations in the field of earthquake physics. Features of this package are listed as below:


- [x] Rate-state friction law
- [ ] Viscoelastic relaxation
- [ ] Applications on oceanic transform faults


## Supporting
This software in this ecosystem is developed as part of academic research in
[Earthquake Physics Lab](http://weilab.uri.edu/) at
[Graduate School of Oceanography](https://web.uri.edu/gso/), University of Rhode Island.
