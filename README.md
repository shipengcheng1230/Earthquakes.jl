This is a suite for numerically simulating earthquake sequences in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). The purpose of this package is to provide efficient Julia implementations for simulations in the field of earthquake physics.

Features of this package are listed as below:

- [x] Rate-State Friction Law
- [x] Okada's Dislocation Method
- [x] Boundary Element Method (Quasi-dynamic)


Features to be implemented:
- [ ] Viscoelastic Relaxation
- [ ] Fully Elastodynamic Effect
- [ ] Off-Fault Materials effect

## Developing
[Demos](https://github.com/shipengcheng1230/JuEQ.jl/tree/master/demos) contains the most primitive implementation of simulation algorithms.

**JuEQ** is still in alpha-stage. Breaking changes are imminent.


## Supporting
This software in this ecosystem is developed as part of academic research in
[Earthquake Physics Lab](http://weilab.uri.edu/) at
[Graduate School of Oceanography](https://web.uri.edu/gso/), University of Rhode Island.
