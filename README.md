This is a suite for numerically simulating earthquake sequences in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). The purpose of this package is to provide efficient Julia implementations for simulations in the field of earthquake physics. Features of this package, at our best hope, are listed as below:


- [x] Rate-State Friction Law (Quasi-dynamic)
- [ ] Fully Elastodynamic
- [ ] Viscoelastic Relaxation


## Developing
At the current stage, I am implementing script-like code-snippets under [Demos](https://github.com/shipengcheng1230/JuEQ.jl/tree/master/demos) for various specific simulation problems. This will be served as guidance for the package development, especially for type systems in this package. 


## Supporting
This software in this ecosystem is developed as part of academic research in
[Earthquake Physics Lab](http://weilab.uri.edu/) at
[Graduate School of Oceanography](https://web.uri.edu/gso/), University of Rhode Island.
