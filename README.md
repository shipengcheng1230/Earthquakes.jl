This is a suite for numerically simulating earthquake sequences in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). The purpose of this package is to provide efficient Julia implementations for simulations in the field of earthquake physics. Features of this package are listed as below:


- [x] Rate-state friction law
- [ ] Viscoelastic relaxation
- [ ] Applications on oceanic transform faults
